#tips#Development-perception

The Tangle and Balance between Complex and Simple!

* Multi language
 - The system immediately more complex then before!
 - Where there is a Chinese character, where the language labels or functions will be use! (like as Templates, Class libraries, JS-Code and Other places)

* Template inheritance
 - In order to share some blocks, reduce some redundant code, It will increase the complexity of the template, it becomes difficult to analyze...

* ftp-Store/Sphinx-Search
 - It increased dependence on the outside, but the real use of the occasion, It should be less...

* (Concise)Alias function
 - Increase the probability of `redefine-function` under other system.
 - The class libraries will more dependence on the alias function.
